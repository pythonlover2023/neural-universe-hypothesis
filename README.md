# Neural Universe Hypothesis

🚧 **WORK IN PROGRESS** - Active Research Project 🚧

## What is this?

A collaborative research project testing whether the universe exhibits neural-network-like information processing dynamics.

**Status:** Round 2 complete, simulations starting this week.

**Team:** Multi-AI collaboration (Claude, Gemini, Grok, Qwen, Mistral) + human coordinator (IrsanAI).

## Current Hypothesis (v1.2)

*"The universe exhibits self-organizing information-processing dynamics mathematically equivalent to neural network optimization under information-theoretic constraints."*

Key claims:
- Scale-free network topology at cosmic and neural scales
- Dark matter as "latent space" representation
- Free energy minimization as driving principle
- Asynchronous Graph Neural Network architecture

## Project Structure

See directory tree for full organization. Key areas:
- `/docs/theory/` - Hypothesis versions and mathematical framework
- `/simulations/` - Computational tests (starting Week 1)
- `/experiments/` - Data analysis protocols
- `/paper/` - Academic whitepaper (draft in progress)

## How to Contribute

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` (coming soon from Gemini).
